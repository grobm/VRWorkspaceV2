# VRWorkspaceV2
This is a Rebuild of an old project in 2000-2003 I built. A simple 360 workspace environment for MacOS, Windows, Linux. This is a hobby project so bare with me.

VRGUIExampleScene.unity contains the code for having numerous web based content in a workspace. You can create more web-based workspaces in the environment. Currently, I am using a curved surface for the Cursor input, will add ability to make is flat surface instead. Also adding bookmarks for web apps, etc.

"`" key enables the workspace menu. Circular cursor is main menu functions, arrow is web content.

I use the following unity packages to create this beta:

Web canvas in 3D worldspace-
